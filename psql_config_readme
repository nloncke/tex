How to configure postgres:

Install postgres.
You'll need to create a user.
Use the command:
sudo -u postgres createuser tex -W 

Your username will be tex, because that's whose going to be the owner of the databases in
the project.

You'll be prompted for a password.  Set it to axal@tex.

We're going to have a bunch of databases, but for now, we just have one, called mydatabase.

If you want to test things by altering a database, you need to create it.
Run:
sudo -u postgres createdb mydatabase tex

Also, you'll need to alter your pg_hba.config file.  It is where you installed postgres.  For me, that is in /etc/postgres/9.1/main

Change the line:
local   all             all                                     peer
to 
local   all             all                                     md5

It is line 90. 

Ok, so now you can run, in the github repository,
python manage.py syncdb

If it doesn't work, let me know.
